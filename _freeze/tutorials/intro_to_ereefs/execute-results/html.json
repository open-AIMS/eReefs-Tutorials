These predictions are routinely generated across the entire extent of the Great Barrier Reef, in near-real time. The end result is a collection of datasets which are, essentially, snapshots of the Reef's condition through time. These datasets are the core output of *eReefs*, with a number of other data products, visualisations, and services built upon them.\n\nA simplified overview of the *eReefs* information platform is shown in @fig-overview. Note that while the core components are covered, there are other components to the *eReefs* platform which have been omitted for the sake of brevity. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A general, simplified overview of the *eReefs* information platform.](../images/ereefs_overview.png){#fig-overview fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The *eReefs* Models\n\nThe eReefs modelling system uses the CSIRO Environmental Modelling Suite to represent the three dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment, and biogeochemistry and ecology processes.\n\nThere are three core components of the eReefs modelling system, a\n\n  * **Hydrodynamic model** predicts the physical state of the system; a\n  * **Sediment transport model** predicts the fate of suspended fine sediments; and a\n  * **Biogeochemical model** predicts water column and benthic production, water quality and nutrient cycling. \n\nThese core models are supported by catchment models, an optical model, data assimilation systems, wave models and a more efficient transport model.\n\nEach of the core models are run using a curvilinear grid, where the total spatial extent of the model is divided into many grid cells (aka pixels) at both 1 km and 4 km resolution; dubbed the **GBR1** and **GBR4** models, respectively (@fig-modelsByResolution). For each grid cell, the models predict values across a consistent set of reef attributes which, across the whole model extent, make up the model outputs for any one point in time.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A quick overview of the core eReefs models and the available resolutions.](../images/core_models_resolution.png){#fig-modelsByResolution fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoth the GBR1 and GBR4 models extend along the Queensland coast from Papua New Guinea to the New South Wales border, and offshore to beyond the continental slope. The 4 km model encompasses some of the Western Coral Sea and the Queensland Plateau, whereas the 1 km model is limited to the shelf regions. The boundaries of both models are shown in @fig-modelBoundariesGrids along with the grid sizes. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![eReefs GBR1 (1 km resolution) and GBR4 (4 km resolution) model boundaries and grid sizes.](../images/gbr1_gbr4_model_boundaries_and_grids.jpeg){#fig-modelBoundariesGrids fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# RECOM\nIn addition to the 1 km and 4 km resolution models, the eReefs platform also contains a Relocatable Coastal Model (RECOM) which offers higher resolution over smaller, user-defined areas.
