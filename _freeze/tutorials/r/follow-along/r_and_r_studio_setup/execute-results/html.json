Each tutorial is placed in its own folder, so to follow along with any particular tutorial just download the respective folder and unzip it in a suitable place on your computer. \n\n## Open tutorial in R Studio\n\nOpen R Studio and create a new project: File > New Project > Existing Directory > Browse > select the unzipped tutorial folder created. Then open the main tutorial (`*.qmd`).\n\nYou can now run the code chunks within the tutorial by clicking the `<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 384 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:0.75em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:green;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M73 39c-14.8-9.1-33.4-9.4-48.5-.9S0 62.6 0 80V432c0 17.4 9.4 33.4 24.5 41.9s33.7 8.1 48.5-.9L361 297c14.3-8.7 23-24.2 23-41s-8.7-32.2-23-41L73 39z\"/></svg>`{=html} button in the top right corner. Chunks can also be run be pressing ctrl+shift+enter and sections of code (e.g. half a line, a single line, multiple lines) can be run by selecting the section and pressing ctrl+enter (replace ctrl with cmd on Mac). \n\n## Installing R packages\n\nYou may encounter the situation where an R package used in the tutorials have not yet been installed on your machine. Installing packages in R is easy, just run the following from an open R console or R code chunk within an R markdown (`*.rmd`) or Quarto markdown (`*.qmd`) file:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"<package name>\")  # replace <package name> with the name of the R package you wish to install\n```\n:::",
