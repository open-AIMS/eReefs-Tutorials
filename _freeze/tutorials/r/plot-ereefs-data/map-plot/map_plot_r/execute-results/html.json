In this tutorial we will look at how to get eReefs data from the [AIMS server](http://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog.html) corresponding to the logged locations of tagged marine animals. Keep in mind, however, that the same methodology can be applied in any situation where we wish to extract eReefs data for a range of points with different dates of interest for each point. \n\n## R packages / Python modules\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(<R package name>) # comment describing what specifically the package is used for in this tutorial\n# E.g. \nlibrary(readr) # to efficiently read in data\nlibrary(janitor) # to create consistent, 'clean' variable names\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and plotting with ggplot2\nlibrary(lubridate) # for working with date and time variables \nlibrary(leaflet) # to create an interactive map of the tracking locations\nlibrary(knitr); library(kableExtra) # for better table printing\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Motivating problem\n\n< **Brief introduction to the mock problem being solved within this tutorial** - including a little bit on the background/context of the problem generally, and a little bit on the specific instance of the problem in this tutorial >\n\n> E.g. The tracking of marine animals is commonly used by researchers to gain insights into the distribution, biology, behaviour and ecology of different species. However, knowing where an animal was at a certain point in time is only one piece of the puzzle. To start to understand *why* an animal was where it was, we usually require information on things like: What type of habitat is present at the location? What were the environmental conditions like at the time? What other lifeforms were present at the tracked location (e.g. for food or mating)? <br> In this tutorial we will pretend that we have tracking data for Loggerhead Sea Turtles and wish to get eReefs data corresponding to the tracked points (in time and space) to understand more about the likely environmental conditions experienced by our turtles. \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n# Read more: < about what >\n\n< **Extra information/background about the problem** - hidden from view initially to not clutter the tutorial with text which is not pertinent to the tutorial, but which may be valuable to users who like to learn about tools in the context of real-world (or at least mock real-world) problems, or which may give greater motivation to some users in general >\n\n:::\n\n## < Data section - e.g. 'The data' or more specific 'Example tracking data' 'Loggerhead turtle tracking data' etc >\n\n< **Description of the dataset** - including citations where appropriate >\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in <data name>\n< data name > <- read_csv(...) |> clean_names()\n```\n:::\n",
